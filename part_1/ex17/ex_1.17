link to image in dockerhub = https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/stutommi/fav-environment

explanation:

Tools that I want in my environment right no:
- Heroku CLI (for deploying webapps)
- Nodejs (for building javascript apps)
- Npm (for javascript projects)
- GCC (for compiling C-language files)
- Git (for version control in all of the above)

Since I don't have that much stuff I need right now, it was quite easy to build an image with
a Docker file based on the latest image. It had everything else mentioned above excluding Heroku, which I downloaded using curl.

contents of docker file is the following:

FROM node
RUN curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.sh | sh
CMD bash
